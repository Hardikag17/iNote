//backend
//userschema of notes DB
//userschema will have the same jwt token as the user loginned
//routes of notesDB
//get route of notes
//post route for updates
//figure it out that the CRUD oprations can be done on client side or i have to shift it to backend.


//frontend
//instead of localstrage store the data in the database notesDB
//whenever notes.jsx fies open it fetches the data just like it fetches the localstorage
//update the database after every 1 minute
